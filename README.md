ContactManager-Example-VisualStudio-CPP
=======================================

### Example OpenSource development repository with issues to fix - Visual Studio C++ ###


The goals for students are:
* be able to fork the repository to their own GitHub account
* be able to clone their forked repository to their local machine
* fix an existing issue or identify and fix a new issue in the code
* submit a pull request back to the original repository


### Description ###

This is a simple console based contact manager.  The manager will read contacts from a CSV file (fname, lname, email) and print, search, add, and delete contacts and also write the contacts back to a file.

The code is written in Visual C++ and contains the necessary files for a Visual Studio 2010 project.  A student may use Visual Studio or may choose to use a simpler text editor to work with this code.

A number of issues are associated with this repository that you can choose to fix.  Some issues are more difficult
than others, and some issue reports are more descriptive than others.  There may be issues in the code that have not been reported, and some reported issues may have misleading descriptions.  This is done to better emulate the fact that bug reports against a project are never perfect.  There are a wide variety of issues listed. Some issues are bugs, some issues are enhancements or requests for new functionality, and some are documentation issues.  Each student should be able to choose an issue of the appropriate difficulty to fix.
